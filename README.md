#### Data Findings
- Data to determine minimum weight eligibility for participating in weightlifting games could have improved the accuracy of weightlifting sport results.​
- Data issues were identified, including incorrect athlete heights, incorrect Olympic year entries, and incorrect ages.​
- Inconsistent data entry for athlete heights, Olympic years, and ages could lead to discrepancies in performance analysis and trend tracking.​
- Temporal Coverage: The dataset only covers data until the Summer Olympics 2016, limiting the ability to track recent performance trends and draw up-to-date insights. Access to more recent data could provide a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of athlete performance over time.​
